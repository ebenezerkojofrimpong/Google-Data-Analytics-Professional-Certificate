## Project Overview
"Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study" is a comprehensive analysis project focused on understanding and optimizing the bike-sharing service provided by Cyclistic. Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company with a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station. Cyclistic offers single-ride, full-day, and annual membership plans. Customers who purchase annual memberships are referred to as "member" customers. Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual, single-ride or full-day users. 

This study involves an in-depth examination of user behavior, trip patterns, and various factors influencing bike usage. Utilizing data analytics tools such as SQL and Tableau, the goal of this analysis is to identify trends in the usage patterns of casual and member customers to help Cyclistic design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual users into annual members. The analysis encompasses diverse aspects, including user demographics, popular routes, peak usage times, and factors affecting ride duration. Through this project, valuable recommendations for business improvement and strategic decision-making are expected to emerge.

We will resolve this case following this methodology:

`ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYSE, SHARE AND ACT`

---

## **ASK**
This phase involves defining the issue to be solved, identifying stakeholders and what their expectations from the project are.

This questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
     
      - How frequently do annual members and casual riders utilize Cyclistic bikes within a given time frame?
     
      - Are there specific days or times when annual members or casual riders are more active?
     
      - What are the most common starting and ending points for trips taken by annual members and casual riders?
     
      - Do annual members and casual riders prefer different types of bikes or routes?
     
      - Are there significant differences in the distances covered by annual members and casual riders?
     
      - How does weather or seasonal variations impact the usage patterns of annual members and casual riders?
     
      - Are there distinct preferences or behaviors in terms of bike usage during weekdays versus weekends for annual members and casual riders?
