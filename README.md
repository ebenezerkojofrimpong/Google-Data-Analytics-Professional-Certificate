## Project Overview
"Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study" is a comprehensive analysis project focused on understanding and optimizing the bike-sharing service provided by Cyclistic. Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company with a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station. Cyclistic offers single-ride, full-day, and annual membership plans. Customers who purchase annual memberships are referred to as "member" customers. Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual, single-ride or full-day users. 

This study involves an in-depth examination of user behavior, trip patterns, and various factors influencing bike usage. Utilizing data analytics tools such as SQL and Tableau, the goal of this analysis is to identify trends in the usage patterns of casual and member customers to help Cyclistic design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual users into annual members. The analysis encompasses diverse aspects, including user demographics, popular routes, peak usage times, and factors affecting ride duration. Through this project, valuable recommendations for business improvement and strategic decision-making are expected to emerge.
